# IF YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES TO THIS FILE YOU HAVE TO RESTART THE ACRYLIC DNS  #

#                                                                           #
# This is the AcrylicHosts.txt file.                                        #
#                                                                           #
# It contains predefined mappings between HOSTNAMES and addresses exactly   #
# the same way the native Windows HOSTS file does but with a few upgrades.  #
#                                                                           #
# The format is: IPADDRESS HOSTNAME1 [HOSTNAME2] [HOSTNAME3] ...            #
#                                                                           #
# Where IPADDRESS is in quad-dotted notation and HOSTNAMES are strings.     #
#                                                                           #
# HOSTNAMES can contain wildcard characters '*' (matches zero or more       #
# characters) and '?' (matches exactly one character):                      #
#                                                                           #
# 127.0.0.1 ad.* ads.*                                                      #
#                                                                           #
# HOSTNAMES can be regular expressions if starting with a '/' character:    #
#                                                                           #
# 127.0.0.1 /^ads?\..*$                                                     #
#                                                                           #
# A '>' character at the beginning of a HOSTNAME is a convenient shortcut   #
# for representing all HOSTNAMES ending with what follows after that        #
# character. For example an entry like this one:                            #
#                                                                           #
# 127.0.0.1 >google.com                                                     #
#                                                                           #
# Is equivalent (and internally is expanded to) an entry like this one:     #
#                                                                           #
# 127.0.0.1 google.com *.google.com                                         #
#                                                                           #
# When using wildcard characters or regular expressions you can specify     #
# exceptions like these for example to filter out all ads.* like HOSTNAMES  #
# except for the ads.test1 and the ads.test2:                               #
#                                                                           #
# 127.0.0.1 ads.* -ads.test1 -ads.test2                                     #
#                                                                           #
# A line starting with the '#' character (and everything after it if it's   #
# found within a line) is considered a comment and therefore ignored.       #
#                                                                           #
# Note: If all HOSTNAMES are provided in ascending order Acrylic will be    #
# able to load them much faster. If you are building a large list of        #
# HOSTNAMES for example then having it sorted before use is better.         #
#                                                                           #
