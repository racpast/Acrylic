# IF YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES TO THIS FILE YOU HAVE TO RESTART THE ACRYLIC  DNS #

#                                                                           #

# It contains predefined mappings between domain names  and  addresses  the #
# same way the native Windows HOSTS file does but with a few upgrades.      #
#                                                                           #
# The format is: IPADDRESS DOMAINNAME1 [DOMAINNAME2] [DOMAINNAME3] ...      #
#                                                                           #
# Where IPADDRESS is in dotted-quad notation for IPv4 or in colon-separated #
# groups for IPv6 and DOMAINNAME1, DOMAINNAME2 and DOMAINNAME3 are strings. #
#                                                                           #
# Domain names can contain wildcard characters '*' (matches  zero  or  more #
# characters) and '?' (matches exactly one character):                      #
#                                                                           #

# Domain names can be regular expressions if starting with a '/' character: #
#                                                                           #

# Also note that there's no final '/' at the end of a regular expression.   #
#                                                                           #
# A '>' character at the  beginning  of  a  domain  name  is  a  convenient #
# shortcut for representing all domain names ending with what follows after #
# that character. For example an entry like this one:                       #
#                                                                           #

#                                                                           #
# Is equivalent (and internally is expanded to) an entry like this one:     #
#                                                                           #

# When using wildcard characters or regular  expressions  you  can  specify #
# exceptions like these for example to filter out  all  ads.*  like  domain #
# names except for the ads.test1 and the ads.test2:                         #
#                                                                           #
# 127.0.0.1 ads.* -ads.test1 -ads.test2                                     #
#                                                                           #
# A line starting with the '#' character (and everything after it  if  it's #
# found within a line) is considered a comment and therefore ignored.       #
#                                                                           #
# Note: If all domain names are provided in ascending order Acrylic will be #
# able to load them much faster.                                            #
#                                                                           #
