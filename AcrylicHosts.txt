# This is the AcrylicHosts.txt file.                                        #
#                                                                           #
# It contains predefined mappings between domain names  and  addresses  the #
# same way the native Windows HOSTS file does but with a few upgrades.      #
#                                                                           #
# The format is: IPADDRESS DOMAINNAME1 [DOMAINNAME2] [DOMAINNAME3] ...      #
#                                                                           #
# Where IPADDRESS is in dotted-quad notation for IPv4 or in colon-separated #
# groups for IPv6 and DOMAINNAME1, DOMAINNAME2 and DOMAINNAME3 are strings. #
#                                                                           #
# Domain names can contain wildcard characters '*' (matches  zero  or  more #
# characters) and '?' (matches exactly one character):                      #
#                                                                           #

# Domain names can be regular expressions if starting with a '/' character: #
#                                                                           #

#                                                                           #
# Note that there's no final '/' at the end of a regular  expression.  More #
# info about the regular expression engine and its syntax can be found  at: #
#                                                                           #

# A '>' character at the  beginning  of  a  domain  name  is  a  convenient #
# shortcut for representing all domain names ending with what follows after #
# that character. For example an entry like this one:                       #
#                                                                           #
# 127.0.0.1 >google.com                                                     #
#                                                                           #
# Is equivalent (and internally is expanded to) an entry like this one:     #
#                                                                           #
# 127.0.0.1 google.com *.google.com                                         #
#                                                                           #
# When using wildcard characters or regular  expressions  you  can  specify #
# exceptions like these for example to filter out  all  ads.*  like  domain #
# names except for the ads.test1 and the ads.test2 domain names:            #
#                                                                           #
# 127.0.0.1 ads.* -ads.test1 -ads.test2                                     #
#                                                                           #
# NXDOMAIN responses can also be mapped to domain names using  all  of  the #
# possibilities (i.e. wildcards & regular expressions) explained above:     #
#                                                                           #
# NX www.google.com                                                         #
# NX ads.* -ads.test1 -ads.test2                                            #
# NX /^ads?\..*$ -ads.test1 -ads.test2                                      #
#                                                                           #
# For easier maintenance of HOSTS files coming from multiple sources it  is #
# also possible to "include"  external  HOSTS  files  using  the  following #
# syntax (the line must start with a '@' character followed by a space  and #
# then by a relative or an absolute file name):                             #
#                                                                           #
# @ AcrylicHostsGroup1.txt                                                  #
# @ AcrylicHostsGroup2.txt                                                  #
#                                                                           #
# A line starting with the '#' character (and everything after it  if  it's #
# found within a line) is considered a comment and therefore ignored.       #
#                                                                           #
# Note: If all domain names are provided in ascending order Acrylic will be #
# able to load them much faster (avoiding a costly sort at the end  of  the #
# load and parse process).                                                  #
#                                                                           #
